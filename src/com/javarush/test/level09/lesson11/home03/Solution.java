/* Turn a method into a try..catch
Read numbers from the keyboard. Write a code for reading numbers from the keyboard into a separate method readData().
    Wrap the whole body of this method (the entire code inside readData() method, except for the declaration of the list where the numbers will be stored) into a try..catch.
    If the user enters some text instead of entering a number, the method has to catch the exception and display to the screen all numbers entered before.
    Display numbers to the screen. Each number should be on a new line. The order of numbers should be just like it was in input.
